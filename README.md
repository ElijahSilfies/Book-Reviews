# Book-Reviews

In this project I will be analyzing book sales data. On July 1st, 2019, this company changed their marketing strategy, so I will be showing the affect of that new strategy on their book sales.

The variables in this data consist of:

date = The date of the purchase in 2019

user_submitted_review = The review on the book from the customer

title = The title of the book purchased

total_purchased = the quantity of books purchased by that customer

customer_type = business or individual based purchased 

Conclusions:

1) The total number of books sold did not increase after July 1st 2019. In fact there was a slight decline in sales.

2)The number of books purchased by businesses increased and the number of books purchased by individuals decreased significantly.

3)There was a gain in about 30 positive reviews which is not a large number compared to 600, but it is still a slight increase. It may be an indication that theyâ€™re on the right track
